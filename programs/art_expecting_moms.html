<p>Meditative Art is a tool to bring one to the present moment, a practice of awareness and attentiveness, peacefulness and quietness. It is a way to connect to within - a 'higher self' or a higher power. </p>

<p>One approach is ego-based, where the sense of “I“ is placed firmly in the center. The “I” is expressing itself: “I create”, “I am the artist”, “I am healing myself through my art work”, etc.</p>

<p>In the second approach, the sense of “I” moves aside or disappears; what remains is a hollow vessel through which something higher or greater can be expressed. For a believer this can be God, for the naturalists it may be nature, or different colors and shapes that wish to be expressed. In this process the artist is humble and receptive. This is the focus of Meditative Art classes – making ourselves available to that which is perfect to be presented.</p>

 

<p>This meditative art program is based on integrity of visual art and music and focuses on the inner state of the artist. 
Music and art can have similar vibes, uniting the classical music of great composers such as Beethoven, Mozart and Vivaldi, with visual art, enhances the healing power of the creative process. Also, what does it mean that the program is focusing on the inner state of the artist? There is a reason why this  program is using a meditative art approach. The simple explanation is that classical music and great pieces of art have high-energy vibes. With the help of classical music and art, the artist can come to the inner peace and harmony with oneself and develop a deeper, more meaningful relationship not only with oneself, but the baby as well.</p>


<p>The goals of the program are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To create an atmosphere where women can experience the joy of harmony and co-creativity.</li>
  <li>To feel as an equal participant in the process of the development of the future life.</li>
  <li>Through the art and music, to start building inner connection between the mom and a baby with the goal of embracing this relationships in a deeper level after birth. </li>
  <li>To experience the realization of inner creative potential through participation in art project.</li>
</ul>


 <p>Each of the lessons is enhanced with a unique combination of scientific research relating to health, genetics, brain development, as well as interesting stories and history behind the famous art and music masterpieces which we will explore. Each week, we will also explore a new theme to offer you a fresh perspective on pregnancy and creativity!</p>

<p>Each class includes design and development of an art project enhanced with musical composition. Each session will include different types of visual art (painting, sculpture, installation, collage) with implementation of Kazinik’s musical approach.</p>

<p>The program will have 12 sessions, each lasting 2 hours. The sessions will be held on a weekly basis. </p>

                              <h2 class="section_header"><span style="color: green;font-weight:bolder;">Why Meditative Art for Expecting Mothers?</span>
                              </h2>

                              <p>
                              Having worked with children for many years, sometimes, one encounters parental misconception and misunderstanding of the natural, simple creativity of a child. The expectations and conceptions of parents are often very limiting for their kids, and not very helpful for their harmonious growth. How interesting is the creative process of a child - it comes from the inner world of meditation and imagination and makes its way onto physical media through trial and error, which is meant to be a fun and exploratory process!!! So, if we, as parents, come into the picture, with no expectations, this could be tremendously helpful to our youngsters, creating the necessary "breathing space" for them. When a future mother gives herself permission to express freely through art with the aim of connecting with her baby, this is already a foundation for mutual freedom and understanding and self-exploration through art.
