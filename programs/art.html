                              <p>The Meditative Art and Music program helps children develop self-awareness and improve
                                   their ability to express themselves. The art guides the discovery of the hidden beauty
                                   in the depths of children’s’ hearts and souls, while music merges in to unravel
                                   this rich world within each child.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                   The Meditative Art is the process of exploring personal creative potential.
                                   It is a way out of "I cannot" towards trusting yourself. Visual arts, in
                                   harmony with classical music, helps children express their feelings and
                                   experiences in the language of colours and images.
                                   The techniques of Meditative Art are especially valuable for autistic kids,
                                   because these kinds much better orient themselves in the language of shapes,
                                   images and colours, than in the language of words.
                                   The Meditative Art program hones children’s ability of self-expression
                                   using creative visual forms.
                              </p>

                                   <p>The Meditative Music and Art classes changed my boys (3 and 5 year old)
                                        significantly. It was a great pleasure to witness their transformation –
                                        they have blossomed like flowers that received much needed water. My boys
                                        started to share their opinions with me freely and discuss a wide range of
                                        topics I did not even know they were interested in. Most importantly, they
                                        sparkle with endless curiosity and hunger for universal knowledge about life.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                        On a personal level, the tremendous experience of observing my children’s
                                        excitement about their own creations, taught me a lot about my children and
                                        the depth of their being. The mutual respect and freedom was the biggest
                                        gift I received from my sons. I am very thankful to the teachers of the
                                        Meditative Music and Art classes for supporting this oasis of creativity
                                        and independence for my children.
                                   </p>
