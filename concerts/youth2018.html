                            This can be through researching obscure works of chamber music, or exploring the connections between jazz and classical music.

                        <p>Growing up in a musical family, I learned the incredible benefits of learning to play music, both as a soloist, and with my siblings. 
                            When we play music by ourselves, we are able to find a voice that can speak in ways that are impossible using words. 
                            As a member of an ensemble, we are able to use our unique musical voices to create something that can be powerful, heroic, subtle,
                            or introspective, and every feeling and emotion in between.  It is because of this, that I continue to play music.

                        <p>"Being a musician is a way of not only connecting artistically with other players, but also a way of communicating with
                            non musicians as well through music.   I cherish all opportunities to play my cello, whether it is in a concert hall, 
                            prison yard, community centre or classroom, and am constantly surprised by the reactions that people have towards 
                            live music, regardless of age, upbringing, or previous artistic experiences."
